# Intact 
A File Encrytion and Decryption Utility. 

## What it will do
- It will allow user to encrypt a text file.(.txt file or .text file)
- It will allow user to encrypt that file with their own pass or key. 
- It wil also allow user to decrypt the file with same pass or key it was encrypted before. 

## How will user to this? 
- Lets say user does this : 
    - to encrypt a file named user.txt; 
        - intact -e user.txt -> this will encrypt user.txt file but with an autogenerated key
                             that key will be shared with user later. so that they can 
                            decrypt that file. 
                            -e flag tells the program to encrypt the file. 
        - intact -d user.txt -p "passkey" -> user.txt file will be decrypted. 
        - intact -e user.txt -p "passkey" -> this encrypts user.txt with user-defined passkey 
- additions after this : 
    - user can select algorithm for encryption
    - support for other files (archived or zipped files, media file)
